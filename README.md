A blog application website to share the user's life experiences to others. It is built using Django as back-end web framework.

How to Use:
------------
1. Install VSCode or use your preferred IDE.
2. Clone this repository to your desktop.
3. In VSCode Terminal or your preferred IDE Terminal, launch
   the virtual environment 'env' using the command
   '<directory_to_this_project> env/bin/ectivate'
4. Or if you're in VSCode, try to use python interpreter
   to the recommended one which automatically selects the
   virtual environment interpreter.
5. If activating virtual environment fails, simply create
   a new virtual environment using the command:
   "python<version> -m venv <your_virtual_environment_name>"
   Eg: "python3 -m venv env" and then activate that new
   virtual environment.
6. Once you have a virtual environment active, simply use the
   command "py manage.py runserver" to launch the django
   blog application.
7. If it asks for any additional packages, install them using
   the commands the terminal gives you.
8. If you encounter any errors, please let me know.
